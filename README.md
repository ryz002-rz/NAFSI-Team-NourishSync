## What is NourishOne?

NourishOne is a static React web app that helps people in the DC, Maryland, and Virginia region find food assistance. It aggregates **737 verified food pantry locations** into a searchable, filterable, map-driven interface with three dedicated portals:

- **Find Food** — Families search for nearby pantries by food type, dietary need, and distance
- **Donate** — Donors see wishlists and high-need areas to direct their contributions
- **Volunteer** — Volunteers find missions matching their skills and languages

Built in 72 hours for the **NourishNet Data Challenge 2026** at the University of Maryland.

## Features

- **737 verified food assistance locations** across MD, DC, and VA
- **Interactive Leaflet map** with color-coded markers (green/orange/blue by portal type) and rich popups
- **Heatmap overlay** showing food insecurity density with urgency legend
- **Smart filtering** by food type, 7 dietary attributes, distance radius, and AND/OR filter mode
- **Voice search** — speak your needs via Web Speech API with English and Spanish keyword mappings
- **6 languages** — English, Spanish, Chinese, French, Amharic, Tagalog
- **First-visit language selector** — full-screen language picker on first launch
- **"Near Me" geolocation** — find the closest pantries with configurable radius (1/5/10/25 mi)
- **Donor wishlists** — see what each pantry needs, sort by highest community need
- **Impact calculator** — estimate CO₂ saved, meals provided, and water conserved from donations
- **Volunteer missions** — filter by required skills and languages, see urgency and nearby opportunities
- **Persistent preferences** — dietary filters, language, search query, and filter mode survive page refresh
- **Fully static** — no backend, no API keys, no cloud services required
- **100% real data** — every location traceable to a verified public source

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or later
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NAFSI-Team-NourishSync.git
cd NAFSI-Team-NourishSync/nourishnet-app
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

> The `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is needed because some packages have peer dependency conflicts. This is safe and expected.

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm start
```

The app opens automatically at **http://localhost:3000**.

---

## Available Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `npm start` | Starts the dev server at localhost:3000 |
| `npm test` | Runs the test suite (includes property-based tests) |
| `npm run build` | Creates a production build in `build/` |
| `npm run deploy` | Builds and deploys to GitHub Pages |

---

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

### First-time setup

1. Update the `homepage` field in `package.json` with your GitHub Pages URL:

```json
"homepage": "https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/NAFSI-Team-NourishSync"
```

2. Ensure `gh-pages` is installed (already in devDependencies):

```bash
npm install --save-dev gh-pages --legacy-peer-deps
```

### Deploy

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This runs `npm run build` automatically, then pushes `build/` to the `gh-pages` branch. Your site will be live within a few minutes.

### Troubleshooting deployment

- The app uses `HashRouter`, so routes look like `https://yoursite.github.io/repo/#/customer`
- If you see a blank page, verify `homepage` in `package.json` matches your actual repo URL

## Data

The production dataset (`locations_final_merged.json`) contains 737 locations with:

- Name, structured address, geocoded coordinates
- Hours, phone, website, requirements
- Food types (16 categories)
- Health/dietary attributes (7 boolean flags: halal, vegan, vegetarian, noBeef, lowGI, freshProduce, dairyFree)
- Insecurity index for need-based prioritization
- Donor fields (wishlist, accepts perishable, drop-off hours)
- Volunteer fields (missions with skills/languages, volunteers needed)
- Full source lineage (source name, URL, extraction page)

See `src/data/DATA_FILES_README.md` for complete documentation of all data files and the pipeline.

---

## Testing

The test suite includes 12 property-based and integration tests covering:

- Route rendering and undefined-route redirects
- Location data schema conformance
- Translation key parity across all locale files
- Language switching and preference persistence
- User preferences localStorage round-trip
- Tailwind config validation
- LanguageToggle and MapView component tests

Run with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Troubleshooting

**`npm install` fails with peer dependency errors**
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Map doesn't render**
Ensure Leaflet CSS is imported. Check that `src/index.css` includes:
```css
@import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
```

**Blank page after deploy**
- Verify `homepage` in `package.json` matches your GitHub Pages URL
- The app uses `HashRouter` — URLs should have `/#/` in them

**i18n not working**
- Verify `src/utils/i18n.js` is imported in `App.js`
- Check that locale files exist in `src/locales/`
